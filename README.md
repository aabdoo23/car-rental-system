# car-rental-system
The objective of this was to implement car rental stimulator as customers will be able to 
reserve their vehicles from anywhere. It was developed and we created classes such as vehicles, 
bus and customer. We used setter, getters, private variables, added the details and defined 
functions in each class. In main, we checked car number to store if found, if found store it in
place and stop searching, if not then keep looking till you do. if rented, print id of renter and if 
not leave. We also printed cars list to choose from, refer to log in success credentials if it is false
then try again. Also, we got the arrays of customers and set customer ID. We also got arrays of 
cars. if rented then rent car and look for customer id in the system, lock car with customer id of 
renter. In array of buses, if true rent lock car with customer id of renter. Car rental stimulator 
was successfully implemented.
